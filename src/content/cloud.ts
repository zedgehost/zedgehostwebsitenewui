export const cloudFaqs: FaqItem[] = [
  {
    q: 'Is cloud hosting better for business websites?',
    a: 'Yes. Cloud hosting offers more flexibility and stability for high-traffic websites, online stores, and growing businesses.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I upgrade resources later?',
    a: 'Yes. Cloud hosting allows easy scaling of CPU, RAM, and storage as your website traffic or workload increases.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does cloud hosting include SSL?',
    a: 'Yes. Secure Sockets Layer certificates are included to protect customer data and improve search and trust signals.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is it suitable for Pakistan businesses?',
    a: 'Yes. Cloud hosting is a strong fit for Pakistani companies that need speed, uptime, and flexibility for modern websites.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is Cloud Hosting?',
    a: 'Cloud Hosting is a faster and more advanced form of Shared Hosting. It gives you access to the simple and familiar cPanel, and is powered by robust Cloud Technologies. Cloud Hosting gives you the power to scale your RAM and CPU resources, and is run on a full SSD server.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the difference between Cloud Hosting and Shared Hosting?',
    a: 'The basic difference between Cloud Hosting and Shared Hosting is the underlying technology that powers both products. With Cloud hosting, you get everything that Shared Hosting offers along with the ability to scale your CPU and RAM, and an extra boost for your website with an all SSD server stack.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is SSD, and how is it different from the existing server?',
    a: 'SSD (Solid State Drives) are a form of storage technology. It is a much faster storage than the existing HDD (Hard Disk Drive) storage. Faster storage means your data gets written to and read from your storage faster. This means that your websites will load much faster if they are running on SSD storage.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is Caching?',
    a: "Website caching is a service that helps load your web pages faster, without having to overload the server during situations of high traffic. We use NGINX Plus caching to ensure that your visitors don't get any lag while loading your website.",
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the limit for additional CPU and RAM?',
    a: 'Upto 8 GB RAM and 8 cores can be added with any Cloud Hosting Plan.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is a Dedicated IP available?',
    a: 'For Cloud Hosting (US) packages, you can purchase a Dedicated IP for an additional cost by raising a support ticket. Unfortunately, for Cloud Hosting (IN) packages, we do not provide a Dedicated IP.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How do I install an SSL certificate on my Website?',
    a: 'To install SSL on your cloud server, you need to get in touch with our support team and we will get it installed for you.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Do you provide any one click install scripts along with Cloud Hosting?',
    a: "Yes - we provide 'Quick Install' which is accessible from your cPanel. Quick Install allows you to plug and play various scripts like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, shopping carts like Zencart, Magento and various other billing, social networking, support and chat modules.",
  },
  {
    q: 'Is Upgrade/Downgrade possible?',
    a: 'No, an upgrade or downgrade is not possible between the plans. However, you can purchase additional RAM and CPU cores as per your requirement.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is your backup policy?',
    a: 'You are responsible for your backups and web content. We create our own weekly backups, and can restore your web, email and database content from those per your request. However, this is NOT a procedure you should rely on to keep copies of your content safe; we recommend you make your own backups. You can take a backup from your cPanel or better, use a remote backup solution.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is there a Money Back Guarantee?',
    a: 'Yes, we do have a 30 day Money Back Guarantee associated with Cloud Hosting.',
