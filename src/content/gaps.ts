You have a variety of options for migrating data into Google Workspace, depending on the size of your organization and the system you're migrating from.

    a: "In addition to accessing Google Workspace mail from the Gmail web interface, you can send and receive mail from your favorite desktop client. Depending on the client, you can use either the IMAP or POP mail protocol. If you're switching to Google Workspace from Microsoft Exchange or some other Outlook service, you can use Google Workspace Sync. This is a plug-in for Outlook 2003, 2007, 2010 or 2013 that lets you use Outlook to manage your Google Workspace mail, calendar and contacts—along with your Outlook notes, tasks and journal entries.",

The enterprise email product supports the POP, IMAP and MAPI protocols.',

  {
    q: 'If I only want one of the products, do I have to buy the entire suite?',
    a: 'Yes. Google Workspace is designed as an all-in-one solution with integrated tools that work seamlessly together. For instance, you can receive a message in Gmail and instantly convert it into a Calendar event. When you make a comment in Docs, Sheets or Slides, collaborators automatically receive email alerts. With a single click, you can launch a Hangouts video meeting from your inbox or calendar. Using these tools as a complete package improves productivity while giving your business the most value. However, you are welcome to purchase the suite and only use the services of your choice.',
